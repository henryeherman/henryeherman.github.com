Research Goals
==============

I have heard that setting goals is important, so here I go.

Currently, I am working with a team on a MURI or a Multi-University Research Initiative.  While there are several MURI project at any one time, our specific project goal is to create a `autonomous jelly fish colony <http://muri.mse.vt.edu/>`_.  Imagine hundreds of jellyfish robots scavaging power, sensing their environments and communication information about their surroundings. *Scary?* Then we must be on to something cool.

        A swarm of jellyfish like robots could be released to explore a region of interest.

UCLA (Newton and I) is currently collaborating with `Virginia Tech <http://www.vt.edu/>`_, `University of Texas, Dallas <http://www.utdallas.edu/>`_, `Providence College <http://www.providence.edu/>`_, and `Stanford <http://www.stanford.edu/>`_. As with any large project, work has been divided into subprojects and UCLA has been tasked with giving the Jelly Fish robot sensing and communication capabilites.

The student working on this project before me recently graduated (or is in the process of doing so).  If you are wondering what he is upto checkout his little `business venture <https://circuithub.com/>`_.  When it finally comes online I guarantee you will be impressed. While he was working on the jelly fish project he decided to explore a fascinating quirk of some tropical fish species, the ability to `electrolocate <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroreception>`_, that is sense the electrical properties of their surroundings.  Many of these 'weakly electric fish' generate electric fields in their local environments and then sense object as the perterb the fields using tiny elecroreceptors on the surface of their skin.

This takes us to the goal of my portion of the project.  I plan to make the jelly fish robot *see* the world as a electric fish would.  How am I planning to do that? I will be releasing more details as the project advances.  Be on the look out!
