About
=====

I love engineering.  Applied science is my thing. Hacking, Making, Building, Desiging ... whatever you call it I like to do it.  I have a pretty diverse background.  I received a Bachelors of Science in Biomedical Engineering from `UCIrvine <http://www.uci.edu>`_ in 2007.  Since then I have found work in information technology, microfluidics and radiochemistry automation.

Recently I found my self enrolled as a graduate student at `UCLA <http://www.ucla.edu>`_. This has been simply awesome. It was my stint in the `Crump Institute For Molecular Imaging <http://www.crump.ucla.edu/>`_ building instruments and "robots" that really pointed me in the direction of Electrical Engineering, and I regret very little of that decision. I spend much of my time in lab these days tinkering with this and that.  I call the Network Embedded Systems Labratory, or `NESL <http://nesl.ee.ucla.edu>`_, my second home.  It is a wonderful place to work with wonderful people.

My current interests? Electrical impedance spectroscopy, remote sensing, under water communication, robotics, machine learing, high voltage, imaging, analog circuits, digital circuits, system design, embedded system programming... really anything I can get my hands on.

The future? Who knows! But it will be fun getting there!
